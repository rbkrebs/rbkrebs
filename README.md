:man_technologist: I've been learning coding since 2015. Before that I used to hate computers, really!! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:


That changed when I started working at Ministry of Agriculture, doing a lot of bureaucratic activities. I realized most of them could be automated with a few lines of code using VBA.
When I ran my first code and it worked I felt I had superpowers! Since then I've never stopped learning new technologies and wondering how to use them to make my day more productive. This is me, I will always try to implement some code to [automate boring stuffs](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).
